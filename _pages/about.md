Hello, I'm Krithika Ramesh, a senior undergraduate student from India. My research interests lie in applications of AI for social good, specifically with respect to the problem of fairness in NLP, and ways in which machine learning can be used to make a more sustainable future. My past work has involved low-resource languages, fairness, explainability and reinforcement learning.

During my undergraduate degree, I co-founded the [Research Society MIT](https://www.researchsocietymit.com), an organization dedicated to guiding undergraduate students from a multitude of different fields in research, to foster and make the research culture more habitable for students. We're always looking for potential collaborations and would be grateful for external assistance, so if you would like to assist the organization in any way, you can reach out to them at their [e-mail][researchsocietymit@gmail.com]. A list of publications and projects underway is available at their [website](https://www.researchsocietymit.com/publications) for your reference.

Iâ€™m always open to discussion, and am incredibly passionate about mentoring students, so if you have any queries related to my work or a potential collaboration, or if there's any possible way I could guide you, feel free to drop me a [mail](kramesh.tlw@gmail.com).

The link to my resume is [here]().
