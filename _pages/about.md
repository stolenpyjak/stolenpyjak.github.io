Hello, I'm Krithika Ramesh, a senior undergraduate student from India. My research interests lie in applications of AI for social good, specifically with respect to the problem of fairness in NLP, and ways in which machine learning can be used to make a more sustainable future. My past work has involved low-resource languages, fairness, explainability and reinforcement learning.

Iâ€™m always open to discussion, and am incredibly passionate about mentoring students, so if you have any queries related to my work or a potential collaboration, or if there's any possible way I could guide you, feel free to drop me a mail at [Email](kramesh.tlw@gmail.com).

The link to my resume is [here]().
